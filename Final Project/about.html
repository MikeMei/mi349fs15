		<div class="about">
			<h1> About Myself </h1>
			<p>  I am a currently junior at Michigan State University studying Computer Science. My programming skills include working knowledge of Python, C++, Java and I currently have a basic understanding of HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Outside of programming my hobbies include cooking, reading, watching movies, playing games and building desktop computers. The purpose of this website is to help you learn a little about myself and to showcase some of my school/side projects and hobbies. I plan to update this webpage throughout my time at MSU to show better knowledge of basic web development. </p>
		</div>

		<div class="current">
			<h1> Current Projects </h1>
			<p> I am currently working on creating two websites for local businesses in my hometown using the knowledge I've gained from W3schools, workshops and my MI-349 class. More information about the two can be found under my portfolio page. </p>
